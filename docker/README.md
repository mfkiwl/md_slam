<h2>Docker</h2>

Build docker image
```
./build
```
Once the image is built, run the docker image, specifying as argument the path to the folder where you have downloaded the data
```
./run path-to-dataset-folder
```
Now can follow the main README.md from section <b>Run MD-SLAM</b>

NOTE: still some problems with our viewer from docker. If you use the docker you cannot vizualize properly the data. This will be fixed soon!
