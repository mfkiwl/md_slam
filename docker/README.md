<h2>Docker</h2>

Build docker image
```
./build
```
Once the image is built, run the docker image, specifying as argument the path to the folder where you have downloaded the data
```
./run path-to-dataset-folder
```
Now you can follow <b>[Run MD-SLAM](https://github.com/digiamm/md_slam/blob/main/README.md#run)</b>

NOTE: still some problems with our viewer from docker. If you use the docker you cannot vizualize properly the data. This will be fixed soon!
